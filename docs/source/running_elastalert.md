As a Kubernetes deployment
==========================

The Docker container for ElastAlert 2 can be used directly as a Kubernetes
deployment, but for convenience, a Helm chart is also available. See the
`Chart Readme <https://github.com/jertel/elastalert2/blob/master/chart/elastalert2/README.md>`_ 
for more information on how to install, configure, and run the chart.

.. _python-instructions:

As a Python package
===================

This method is only recommended for advanced users, as providing support is very
challenging due to the numerous differences between everyone's environment.

Requirements
------------

- Elasticsearch 7, 8, or 9 or OpenSearch 1, 2, or 3
- ISO8601 or Unix timestamped data
- Python 3.13. Require OpenSSL 3.0.8 or newer. Note that Python 3.12 is still supported but will be removed in a future release.
- pip
- Packages on Ubuntu 24.04: build-essential python3-pip python3.13 python3.13-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev

If you want to install python 3.13 on CentOS, please install python 3.13 from the source code after installing 'Development Tools'.

Downloading and Configuring
---------------------------

You can either install the latest released version of ElastAlert 2 using pip::

    $ pip install elastalert2

or you can clone the ElastAlert2 repository for the most recent changes::

    $ git clone https://github.com/jertel/elastalert2.git

Install the module::

    $ pip install "setuptools>=11.3"
    $ python setup.py install

Next, open up ``examples/config.yaml.example``. In it, you will find several configuration
options. ElastAlert 2 may be run without changing any of these settings.

See :doc:`configuration` for details on all the configuration options available.

Save the file as ``config.yaml``

Manually Creating the ElastAlert 2 Indices
-------------------------------------------

ElastAlert 2 saves information and metadata about its queries and its alerts back
to Elasticsearch. This is useful for auditing, debugging, and it allows
ElastAlert 2 to restart and resume exactly where it left off. This is not required
for ElastAlert 2 to run, but highly recommended.

First, we need to create an index for ElastAlert 2 to write to by running
``elastalert-create-index`` and following the instructions. Note that this manual 
step is only needed by users that run ElastAlert 2 directly on the host, whereas 
container users will automatically see these indexes created on startup.::

    $ elastalert-create-index
    New index name (Default elastalert_status)
    Name of existing index to copy (Default None)
    New index elastalert_status created
    Done!

For information about what data will go here, see :ref:`ElastAlert 2 Metadata
Index <metadata>`.

Starting ElastAlert 2 via Python CLI
------------------------------------

There are two ways of invoking ElastAlert 2 without Docker. As a daemon, through Supervisor
(http://supervisord.org/), or directly with Python as shown below::

    $ python -m elastalert.elastalert --verbose --rule example_frequency.yaml  # or use the entry point: elastalert --verbose --rule ...

The argument ``--verbose`` sets it to display INFO level messages, while ``--rule example_frequency.yaml`` specifies a single rule to
run, otherwise ElastAlert 2 will attempt to load the other rules in the ``examples/rules`` folder.

Creating a Rule
===============

* rule
  * == query to perform + parameters | trigger a match + alerts to fire / EACH match
  * _Example:_ ["example_frequency.yaml"](/examples/rules/example_frequency.yaml)
  * POSSIBLE fields -- to -- specify
    * `es_host` & `es_port`
      * == Elasticsearch cluster / we want to query
    * `name`
      * this rule's unique name 
      * ‚ùåif 2 rules have the SAME name -> ElastAlert 2 will NOT start‚ùå
    * `type`
      * DIFFERENT typeS / EACH rule
      * can take DIFFERENT parameters
      * built-in
        * `frequency` type
          * if there are > `num_events` | `timeframe` -> match
        * [list](ruletypes.md)
    * `index`
      * == index(es)' name -- to -- query
      * if you are using Logstash -> by default,`"logstash-*"`
    * `num_events`
      * ‚ö†Ô∏èrequirements‚ö†Ô∏è
        * `frequency` type
        * `num_events`
      * == threshold | alert is triggered
    * `timeframe`
      * == time period | `num_events` MUST occur
    * `filter`
      * == list of Elasticsearch filters / filter results
        * ‚ö†Ô∏èif you do NOT need it -> set `filter: []`‚ö†Ô∏è
      * [here](recipes/writing_filters.md)
    * `alert`
      * == list of alerts / run | EACH match
      * [alert types](alerts.md#alert-types)
      * The email alert requires an SMTP server
for sending mail. By default, it will attempt to use localhost. This can be
changed with the ``smtp_host`` option.

``email`` is a list of addresses to which alerts will be sent.

There are many other optional configuration options, see :ref:`Common
configuration options <commonconfig>`.

All documents must have a timestamp field. ElastAlert 2 will try to use
``@timestamp`` by default, but this can be changed with the ``timestamp_field``
option. By default, ElastAlert 2 uses ISO8601 timestamps, though unix timestamps
are supported by setting ``timestamp_type``.

As is, this rule means "Send an email to elastalert@example.com when there are
more than 50 documents with ``some_field == some_value`` within a 4 hour
period."

See :ref:`the testing section for more details <testing>` on how to test a specific rule file without sending alerts.

Operational Review
==================

When ElastAlert 2 starts and output is configured to be sent to the console, it will resemble the following::

    No handlers could be found for logger "Elasticsearch"
    INFO:root:Queried rule Example rule from 1-15 14:22 PST to 1-15 15:07 PST: 5 hits
    INFO:Elasticsearch:POST http://elasticsearch.example.com:14900/elastalert_status/elastalert_status?op_type=create [status:201 request:0.025s]
    INFO:root:Ran Example rule from 1-15 14:22 PST to 1-15 15:07 PST: 5 query hits (0 already seen), 0 matches, 0 alerts sent
    INFO:root:Sleeping for 297 seconds

Let's break down the response to see what's happening.

``Queried rule Example rule from 1-15 14:22 PST to 1-15 15:07 PST: 5 hits``

ElastAlert 2 periodically queries the most recent ``buffer_time`` (default 45
minutes) for data matching the filters. Here we see that it matched 5 hits:

.. code-block::

    POST http://elasticsearch.example.com:14900/elastalert_status/elastalert_status?op_type=create [status:201 request:0.025s]

This line showing that ElastAlert 2 uploaded a document to the elastalert_status
index with information about the query it just made:

.. code-block::

    Ran Example rule from 1-15 14:22 PST to 1-15 15:07 PST: 5 query hits (0 already seen), 0 matches, 0 alerts sent

The line means ElastAlert 2 has finished processing the rule. For large time
periods, sometimes multiple queries may be run, but their data will be processed
together. ``query hits`` is the number of documents that are downloaded from
Elasticsearch, ``already seen`` refers to documents that were already counted in
a previous overlapping query and will be ignored, ``matches`` is the number of
matches the rule type outputted, and ``alerts sent`` is the number of alerts
actually sent. This may differ from ``matches`` because of options like
``realert`` and ``aggregation`` or because of an error.

``Sleeping for 297 seconds``

The default ``run_every`` is 5 minutes, meaning ElastAlert 2 will sleep until 5
minutes have elapsed from the last cycle before running queries for each rule
again with time ranges shifted forward 5 minutes.

Say, over the next 297 seconds, 46 more matching documents were added to
Elasticsearch::


    INFO:root:Queried rule Example rule from 1-15 14:27 PST to 1-15 15:12 PST: 51 hits
    ...
    INFO:root:Sent email to ['elastalert@example.com']
    ...
    INFO:root:Ran Example rule from 1-15 14:27 PST to 1-15 15:12 PST: 51 query hits, 1 matches, 1 alerts sent

The body of the email will contain something like::

    Example rule

    At least 50 events occurred between 1-15 11:12 PST and 1-15 15:12 PST

    @timestamp: 2015-01-15T15:12:00-08:00

If an error occurred, such as an unreachable SMTP server, you may see:

.. code-block::

    ERROR:root:Error while running alert email: Error connecting to SMTP host: [Errno 61] Connection refused


Note that if you stop ElastAlert 2 and then run it again later, it will look up
``elastalert_status`` and begin querying at the end time of the last query. This
is to prevent duplication or skipping of alerts if ElastAlert 2 is restarted.

By using the ``--debug`` flag instead of ``--verbose``, the body of email will
instead be logged and the email will not be sent. In addition, the queries will
not be saved to ``elastalert_status``.

Disabling a Rule
================

To stop a rule from executing, add or adjust the `is_enabled` option inside the
rule's YAML file to `false`. When ElastAlert 2 reloads the rules it will detect
that the rule has been disabled and prevent it from executing. The rule reload
interval defaults to 5 minutes but can be adjusted via the `run_every`
configuration option.

Optionally, once a rule has been disabled it is safe to remove the rule file, if
there is no intention of re-activating the rule. However, be aware that removing
a rule file without first disabling it will _not_ disable the rule!
